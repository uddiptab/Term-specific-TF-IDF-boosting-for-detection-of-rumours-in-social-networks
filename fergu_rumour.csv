http://t.co/R6bxjsY9CZ"
7) #MikeBrown was approached for mouthing off to a cop (both  #Ferguson PD &amp; eyewitness testimonies reflect this). NOT as a robbery suspect
Darren Wilson is a six year veteran of the #Ferguson Police and had no disciplinary actions against him.
"Because, of course, when someone commits a robbery they stroll down the middle of the street where everyone can see them. #Ferguson"
"REMINDER: #MikeBrown was a kid who just wanted to walk down a street. And for that, HE IS DEAD. Those are the facts. #Ferguson"
today #MichaelBrown would've completed his 1st week of college &amp; #Ferguson police chief spent most time suggesting he's the criminal
"Police reports released this morning indicate Mike Brown was a suspect in a ""strong-armed"" robbery in #Ferguson"
Hold on while Chief Jackson sprinkles a little crack on that Mike Brown crime scene ... #Ferguson
#MikeBrown wanted to walk down the street. And he is dead. And the #Ferguson PD is using his silence in death to make him a criminal.

If there is surveillance of a robbery why release stills and not the video itself? #Ferguson
"#Ferguson police hand out info to make Michael Brown seem like a thug. But nothing on how he was actually killed, interaction with officer."
I'm NOT believing this story because I know how the police lie and will keep lying and will organize together AND LIE. #MIKEBROWN #Ferguson
It's not #MikeBrown in those #Ferguson police video stills. Not unless he changed his shoes after the robbery but before he met the officer.

Bottom line: cops are supposed to use deadly force only when lives are at risk. You don't shoot robbery suspects. #Ferguson

Being shot 10 times in the street for stealing cigars is due process? No arrest. No trial. No conviction?just immediate execution. #Ferguson

"And I feel silly for pointing this out but...

So lets recap. No dashboard cam of the incident. But definitely photos of Michael Brown in a store. Funny how that happens #NMOS14 #Ferguson
"Cops were extra aggressive to incite fear and cause chaos, giving the #Ferguson PD time to destroy and/or manufacture any ""evidence"" needed"
"The police chief is a 5 star general in projection, imagination and deflection...took a week to hatch this theory #Ferguson"
Just did a google map search. There are 2 Quick Trips in #Ferguson and they are on opposite ends of the town. Did #MikeBrown teleport?
"basically #Ferguson PD did an opposition research dump on mike brown, and not their jobs"
Did anyone think of comparing the clothes that #MikeBrown was wearing when he was laying on the street to the security footage? #Ferguson
"In 2009 #Ferguson PD beat a black man, then charged him for getting blood on their uniforms http://t.co/Y1QTm1BZyt http://t.co/KcuZ5VFMOn"
so #MikeBrown's hat disappeared and he changed into shoes right? #Ferguson http://t.co/2zu5sUH84S
so if he was with #DorianJohnson at the robbery why wasn't he in custody? All media outlets interviewed him before the police #Ferguson
The selective release of information by #Ferguson PD tells us nothing about the shooting. Instead appears to be a basic smear job.
Here's the police report. Somehow #Ferguson cops valued a box of Swishers at nearly $50. Time to stop smokin I guess http://t.co/8ZkvrHkApc

"So since we now know the officer knew nothing abt a robbery, we must ask why those tapes were released? #Ferguson. But we know why."

"So, to sum up: 1) Darren Wilson KNEW NOTHING of the robbery, 2) shot #MikeBrown over jaywalking, and 3) was allowed to escape #Ferguson."
#Ferguson chief said the officer was unaware of any robbery &amp; stopped #MikeBrown for jay walking. #TheJig http://t.co/uLWzIJH5WJ
Are we supposed to be cool &amp; remain calm when the police after MURDERING a teenager SLANDER him to hide the killing behind racism? #Ferguson
#Ferguson police chief says officer Darren Wilson didn't know #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect http://t.co/SbpxzwwZWs
"They desecrated #mikebrown's body then they desecrated his memory and plight for justice. 

EXPLAIN THIS. 

#Ferguson #DONTSHOOT"
I'm so disgusted. #Ferguson RT @ZandarVTS: This has now devolved into the worst police shooting cover-up attempt in US history.
Report: #Ferguson cop identified as unarmed teen's killer skipped town days ago http://t.co/5GQvgcw3LJ
VIDEO Police release surveillance tape from #Ferguson store related to #MichaelBrown: http://t.co/hEIdfPTX60 http://t.co/CIM7L6TJND
"Increasingly seems like #Ferguson police dept. spent all week playing dress-up, couldn't even be bothered to get its story straight"
In what world do you let a cop who killed someone leave town? http://t.co/T0A3rn2PeL #Ferguson
#Ferguson Police Chief says #MikeBrown was stopped because he was walking in road NOT because he was suspected of stealing cigars.
"Oh, whoops, the robbery had nothing to do with #MikeBrown being stopped, but at least now half of America thinks it did. - #Ferguson PD"
.@CNN KEEPS playing the video while saying it has nothing to do with the murder of #MikeBrown this is PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFAE. #FERGUSON
"If anyone's looking for a reason to murder me execution-style in the street, I stole a coke from a Walmart when I was 19. #Ferguson"
UPDATE - Shooter #DarrenWilson didn't know #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect: #Ferguson http://t.co/p05krSfaXL http://t.co/R8CJVoTvex
This is what #Ferguson PD did to #HenryDavis in 2009 when they mistook him for a man with an outstanding warrant http://t.co/ZdHpyHfrCh
"Since FBI is investigating the shooting, isn't Darren Wilson a fugitive &amp; the cops who let him leave accessories after the fact? #Ferguson"
to be clear: an unarmed teenager POSSIBLY stealing a box of cigars does not warrant being shot to death by the police. #Ferguson
People got even angrier after the admission that the #Ferguson store theft had nothing to do with why Brown was stopped by Wilson.
"#Ferguson PD charged #HenryDavis w/ ""destruction of property"" for bleeding on their uniforms: http://t.co/qQWPClW3tG http://t.co/5U3nMoMiF2"
"Oh. So NOW the #Ferguson police chief says the cop didn't know about the robbery when he stopped #MikeBrown. The kid was ""jaywalking""? BS!"
Anybody else thinks the #Ferguson police chief is just making this up as he goes along? This is beyond embarrassing. It's shameful!

#ferguson police engaged in character assassination to cover up actual assassination. you. simply. don't. shoot. unarmed. teenagers. EVER.
now shameful #ferguson police say Brown wasn't even a robbery suspect when he was shot. he was just an unarmed kid walking down the street.

"Everybody was orgasming about a white cop killing an ""innocent"" black kid. Reality kicked them in the nuts. #Ferguson http://t.co/hUx29W6P10"
#Ferguson chief let most of day go by b4 disclosing (after repeated Qs) that cop who killed #MikeBrown knew nothing about robbery. DANGER
"Store owner told @FOX2now Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown; said it was someone else #Ferguson"
FACT. We know more about how #MikeBrown allegedly stole cheap cigars than how and why a #Ferguson police officer shot and killed him.
"The press conf makes #Ferguson PD look like they've gone from stonewalling to counter punching. We give up a name, we drag his thru the mud."

Is the Police Chief in #Ferguson changing the story?  https://t.co/8ujqp0lpb5
"MSNBC is literally reporting that Police Chief CLEARLY said it was about jay walking. 

This is a fucking clown show. #Ferguson"
Police in #Ferguson once charged a man for bleeding on their uniforms after 4 of them beat him http://t.co/op11jbVEUq http://t.co/crECAGF4t0
"Remarkably, despite the military-style police presence in #Ferguson, a known killer was able to skip town http://t.co/lDGjp6Wt1j"
Americans are 8 times more likely to be killed by a police officer than by a terrorist. #Ferguson
"Shot ten times.
Unarmed.
What else is there to talk about?
#StopTheSmear #Ferguson"
I refuse to call the #Ferguson police chief incompetent when it is so clear the release of that video was calculated and brazen. #MikeBrown
