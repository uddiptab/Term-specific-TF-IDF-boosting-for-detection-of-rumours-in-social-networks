Australian Police Operation Under Way In Sydney http://t.co/FHC09vZ3yP
Prayers needed for the situation happening in Sydney right now.
This is not going to end well in Sydney . Wake up Britain it's coming here.
Any lone nutjob who wants international attention for a crime now just has to wave a black flag around. Voila #sydney
Careful what you post about #Lindt Sydney siege; it feeds into bad guys' actions/reactions. Emergency responders need clear air.
Every citizen of Sydney has an obligation to help Police etal maintain operational security around Lindt Cafe. Do NOT tweet Police moves
"If you are in Sydney near Martin Place, do NOT tweet police movements, or mention them anywhere else."
"I repeat=&gt;if you are in Sydney, do NOT tweet or post news of what Police are doing around Martin Place. Assume jihadists follow social media"
"What's happening in Sydney will happen in the uk it's inevitable, and our political leaders will have blood on their hands"
No one fully knows what is happening with the #sydneysiege but we do know anti-muslim and ignorant speculation isn't needed.
"DEVELOPING: Major police operation underway at Martin Place in Sydney's central business district, police tell @ABC News."
Fingers crossed for Sydney. One day we won’t live in a world where humans terrorise each other
"Be especially kind to each other today, Sydney. Especially to our Muslim friends - don't let good people be judged by the actions of a few."
Do not forget that the overwhelming majority of Muslims are as disgusted by the actions of these few fanatics as you or I are #sydneysiege
Thoughts and prayers with everyone involved in this terrible situation in Sydney right now. #peace
"There are no verses in the Quran about Me wanting anyone to hold hostages in a chocolate shop in Sydney, you terrorist fucks."
